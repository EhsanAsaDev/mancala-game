This is my technical assignment for Bol.com

### What I did
I design and develop base on Spring framework.

- `Spring Boot`
- `WebSocket` , for getting changes and refreshing  game board
- `MongoDB`, for persisting the Game information
- `HTML and js`, for providing simple UI
- `Docker`, for containerization of services
- `Docker-Compose`, to link the containers


### How to launch
First, you should build and package jar file with Maven.
Then,  I provided a docker file, so you should create an image.
Finally, by the docker-compose file, you can launch it.
Via the home page (http://localhost:8080/) you can access to the game UI.
